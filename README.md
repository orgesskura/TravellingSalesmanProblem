# TravellingSalesmanProblem

Coursework for Inf2:IADS

In this coursework we try to solve the problem of travelling salesman. Link to that is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem

We develop some heuristics for solving the problem. First I write the code for Swap Heuristics which is the simplest heuristics and does not perform very well.

Then I do Two-Opt Heueristics which works a lot better than the Swap Heuristics.

In the other part I develop a Greedy Algorithm to solve the problem which works a lot better than SwapHeuristics but not as good as TwoOpt.

In part C, I have to pick and develop an algorithm of choice. I choose Lin-Kerninghan. Link to that is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernighan%E2%80%93Lin_algorithm

In part D, i run different tests for my algorithms.

The algorithms are in graph.py while the tests are in tests.py. The report for the coursework is in report.pdf .
